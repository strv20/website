title: "Peptide‚ÄêReinforced Amphiphilic Polymer Conetworks"
subtitle: "Improving the mechanical properties of APCNs"
excerpt: "The mechanical properties of bioinspired amphiphilic polymer conetworks (APCNs) are tailored through the reinforcement with peptide-polydimethylsiloxane-peptide triblock copolymer crosslinkers and characterized through physical, morphological, and mechanical characterization. The obtained results are compared with non-peptidic APCNs which show there is significant improvement in stress, strain, and toughness."
