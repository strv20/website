Last November, I received an email from the Organization for Women in Science for the Developing World (OWSD) about the Female Science talent intensive track program. After searching their website, I realized that this was something I needed. I applied and luckily was accepted. Now, having recently arrived home from the Fall meeting, I can honestly say it exceeded even my highest expectations. The cohort I participated with was made up of amazing women, who reminded me once again of the benefits of having a strong female support network! 

If you are considering applying, I strongly recommend you try, as you definitely won't regret it! 

The application depends soley on you. No recommendation letters are needed for this program, just a motivation letter and a 3 minute video introduction - which can even be filmed on a smartphone. 

My main recommendation for preparing the application is BE YOU! Show who you are, your goals and especially what makes you stand out from others as an amazing scientist! It is not just about conventional metrics (papers, funding etc) - although they are also important - but about having a vision of what you want to do and how the Falling Walls programme fits within that. Always remember that each scientific journey is unique and that is what will make a difference in your research and applications like this.

For my video, I thought about my background, what brought me where I am today, what are my motivations to keep on going, even when the experiments do not work as we hope. Also, I remembered the reasons I like to do scientific outreach, networking and my dream to inspire the new generation of scientists, especially from underrepresented groups. It is also about introducing yourself as a person - so Hedwig (my dog), Ivanna (my niece) and others were also mentioned. Female scientist are not brains on a stick, and we need to remember that to get the best from ourselves and those we work with. 

Practically, I prepared a script and recorded several takes before I was happy with it! I asked family and friends - some of whom are also scientists - for feedback, which included things like not rushing, working out where to pause for effect and avoiding filler words. So, try to start early and involve those you trust.

One thing I particularly remember is everything I said were things I honestly believe in. When you do so, no matter how unconventional it might be, it helps the evaluation commitee connect with you and engage with your ambitions! 

For the motivation letter, draft it yourself, with your personal touch. Please remember that while using AI tools might be tempting, AI will suggest similar things to all the applicants, which won't help you stand out. The requirements for the motivation letter are established on the application package. Playing with showing the best of you in 300 characters is indeed a challenge. So I would recommend you to write a longer description for each section and then reduce it to the essentials. 

Good luck with your application!
