    As a woman of mixed Latinx/Black heritage from a less developed country, I have always had a strong interest in diversity and inclusion activities. I focus on supporting woman, underrepresented groups and supporting mental health in academia through different programs to bring about structural change to improve support and help them realize their full potential.

** No content below YAML for the teaching _index. This file provides front matter for the listing page layout and sidebar content. It is also a branch bundle, and all settings under `cascade` provide front matter for all pages inside teaching/. You may still override any of these by changing them in a page's front matter.**
