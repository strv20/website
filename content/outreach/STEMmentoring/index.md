Through my journey, I had several mentors who supported and encouraged me to get to where I am today. I am aware that without mentoring, role models and the right guidance, it might be harder or even impossible to explore the full academic potential.

As a way to share the knowledge and experiences that have shaped my academic path, and return the mentorship I have previously received and continue receiving,I have started offering individual or school groups mentoring sessions in English, Spanish or Portuguese.
