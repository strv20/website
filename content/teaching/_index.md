    I have a strong interest in teaching and mentoring.I like to teach students from the undergraduate level up to Masters, as I feel the future of science is based on the knowledge transfer to future generations. I have supervised several exchange, Bachelors and Master projects. Additionally, I have taught on First year laboratories and Master laboratory courses.

** No content below YAML for the teaching _index. This file provides front matter for the listing page layout and sidebar content. It is also a branch bundle, and all settings under `cascade` provide front matter for all pages inside teaching/. You may still override any of these by changing them in a page's front matter.**
