After a wonderful week in Colombus, OH, we moved to the ACS Fall 2024 conference in Denver, CO. I can only say I had a wonderful time and I am grateful to have been able to be there to support my owner. We met wonderful scientists, Including the ACS president, ACS president-elect and Frances Arnold, 2018 Nobel Laureate. 

I networked a lot and appreciate the inclusivity of the ACS in accepting and acknowledging me accompanying my scientist around the meeting. 

Special thanks to Fernando Gomollon Bel, for introducing me to the ACS President, even before introducing my scientist!
