After a wonderful week in Colombus, OH, we moved to the ACS Fall 2024 conference in Denver, CO. I Can only say I had a wonderful time and IÂ´m greatful to be such a big support for my owner. We met wonderful scientist, Including the ACS president, ACS president elect and Frances Arnold, 2018 Nobel Laureate. 

I networked a lot and appreciate the inclusivity of the ACS to accepting and acknowledging me accompanying my scientist during this conference. 

A big thanks to Fernando Gomollon Bel, for introducing me, before introducing my Scientist to the ACS President!
