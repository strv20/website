    The Face besides, behind and on front of my academic journey is my academic puppy Hedwig. She has accepted the challenge of moving with me though four different countries always with a smile and good attitude. Here we will share about out academic adventures together and how she has supported this journey. She is also always willing to wag her tail and give love to all those academics who miss their pets.

** No content below YAML for the teaching _index. This file provides front matter for the listing page layout and sidebar content. It is also a branch bundle, and all settings under `cascade` provide front matter for all pages inside teaching/. You may still override any of these by changing them in a page's front matter.**
