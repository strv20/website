    I have a strong interest in teaching, having qualified for Associate Fellowship of the Higher Education Academy in 2017. There are huge potential benefits from research based teaching, both in giving students exposure to the latest ideas and practices and for researchers. I have supervised several Honours and Masters projects for different programmes, including the Masters in Physics and BSc in Neuroscience. Additionally, I am course tutor for the Edinburgh Imaging Academy's (Clinical) Applications in Disease modules.

** No content below YAML for the teaching _index. This file provides front matter for the listing page layout and sidebar content. It is also a branch bundle, and all settings under `cascade` provide front matter for all pages inside teaching/. You may still override any of these by changing them in a page's front matter.**
