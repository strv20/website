  I am a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) physicist and lecturer at the University of Edinburgh. Most of my research focuses on measuring how well blood vessels are working using MRI. I have worked at the University of Edinburgh since 2016, before which I completed my PhD at the University of Aberdeen (2012-2016) working on brain imaging, and degrees in applied and pure mathematics (Heriot-Watt University and University of Glasgow).
  
  I have worked on different international studies using advanced brain imaging and image analysis techniques to understand how damage to the brain causes more severe disease. I was heavily involved with the H2020 funded SVDs\@Target project as well as a Leducq Transatlantic Network on perivascular spaces. 
  
  In addition to my research experience I have also been involved with teaching through Edinburgh Imaging Academy. I currently supervise two PhD students (Keelin Ridge and Grant Kirkwood, as first and secondary supervisor respectively). I have also supervised several student projects at Masters and Honours level.
  
  The below links explain different aspects of my work in more detail.
