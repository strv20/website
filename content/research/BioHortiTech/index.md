During the first year of my Post-Doctoral research, I participated on the BioHortiTech project, where I was developing layer-by-layer encapsulation of Trichoderma spores for plant protection. The encapsulated spores were tested in greenhouse and field through collaborations with inhort, Poland.

The research developed throughout this project, has currently generated two papers, which can be found under publications.
