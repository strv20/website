Project Collaboration which funded my PhD research. It focused on bioinspired materials, my research more specifically on using bioinspiration to develop mechanically reinforced amphiphilic polymer conetworks. 

Throughout my PhD I collaborated directly with Prof. LaShanda KorelyÂ´s Research laboratory from University of Delaware.
