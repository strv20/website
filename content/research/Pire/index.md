Project Collaboration which funded my PhD research. It focused on bioinspired materials, my research more specifically on using bioinspiration to develop mechanically reinforced amphiphilic polymer conetworks. 

My PhD was developed at Prof. Nico Brun´s research laboratory. Throughout my PhD I collaborated directly with Prof. LaShanda Korely´s Research laboratory from University of Delaware.
