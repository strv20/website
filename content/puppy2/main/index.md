  I am a material scientist and chemist. I currently work as a post-doctoral researcher in Sustainable Polymer materials at the University of Twente. Most of my research focuses on the future of plastics, by developing sustainable polymeric solutions.

  I completed an international and interdisciplinary PhD in pure and applied chemistry at the University of Strathclyde (2018-2022). My thesis focused on improving the mechanical properties of Bioinspired Amphiphilic polymer conetworks.

  My fascination with Bioinspiration started in 2012, while I was doing an exchange program in France. Following this I pursued my passion by completing a Masters degree at ETH Zurich in the Materials Science department.

  I have worked in different research groups and countries, which has provided me with a very diverse and understanding scientific outlook.

  In addition to my research, I am passionate on scientific outreach, mental health in academia and inspiring under-represented groups to follow scientific careers.
 
  The below links explain different aspects of my work in more detail.
